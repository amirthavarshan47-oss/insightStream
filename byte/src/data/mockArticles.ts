    title: "Breakthrough in Cancer Treatment Shows 90% Success Rate",
    description: "Indian researchers develop revolutionary immunotherapy technique that has shown remarkable results in clinical trials.",
    content: "A team of researchers at the All Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has achieved a major breakthrough in cancer treatment with a new immunotherapy technique showing a 90% success rate in clinical trials. The innovative treatment, developed over five years, uses the patient's own immune system to target and destroy cancer cells more effectively. The technique has been particularly successful in treating blood cancers and certain solid tumors that were previously considered difficult to treat. Dr. Ramesh Gupta, lead researcher, explained that the treatment involves extracting immune cells from patients, genetically modifying them in the laboratory, and then reinfusing them to fight cancer more aggressively. The clinical trial included 200 patients across three cancer types, with 180 showing complete or significant tumor reduction. The treatment also showed fewer side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. The research team is now preparing for larger Phase III trials and hopes to make the treatment commercially available within two years.",
